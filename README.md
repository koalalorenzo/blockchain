# SpaceChain
This repository contains the source code of SpaceChain, an open source
experiment to build from scratch a blockchain. Its intent is to make
it simple to study and understand how a blockchain works.

This project is not optimized or ready for production, since its purpose is not
to provide a stable solution. No paper required. Just fun.

# Learning "Blockchain"
This repository contains the source code of SpaceChain, an open source
experiment to build from scratch a blockchain. Its intent is to make
it simple to study and understand how a blockchain works.

The purpose is to create a distributed software capable of defining the order
of some BlockData (known as Transaction when solving the [Double Spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending)
problem).

This project is not optimized or ready for production, since its purpose is not
to provide a stable solution. No paper required. Just fun.

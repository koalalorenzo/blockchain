# Learning "Blockchain"
This repository contains the source code of SpaceChain, an open source
experiment to build from scratch a blockchain. Its intent is to make
it simple to study and understand how a blockchain works.

The purpose is to create a distributed software capable of defining the order
of some BlockData. This project is not focusing in solving the 
[Double Spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending) problem, nor 
explore new way to replace the 
[PoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) nor improve metrics.

This project is not optimized or ready for production, since its purpose is not
to provide a stable solution. No paper required. Just fun.

This project is not implementing networking side, discovery and latency, 
instead it will use IPFS to storage and distribution.
